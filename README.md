-  I'm currently in my first year, majoring in Computer Engineering.
-  Slowly but surely getting better at coding.
-  I am mostly focused on learning Java and C++ and keeping a high GPA.
-  I am also looking forward to improving my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.
-  Occasionally coding personal projects on Flutter.
